# N-Queens Genetic Algorithm (C++)

## Overview

This repository presents a C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem solved using a Genetic Algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N non-attacking queens on an N*N
chessboard. 
A genetic algorithm, inspired by natural selection, is an effective heuristic approach to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for such complex problems.
